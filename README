This is the code repository for the GSB for CITA's purposes. 

In the repository you will see several folders and files. These folders and 
files contain code that is linked symbolically to somewhere else. Changes to 
code can be done in the repository or on the symbolic links.

To have git ignore certain files put the file name or name pattern in the file,
 '.gitignore'.
