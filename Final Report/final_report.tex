\begin{abstract}
The project consisted of two main goals. The first was to devise a standard procedure to locate and eliminate radio frequency interference, within the near vicinity of the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope. The second aim was to continue the investigation of the epoch of reionization.

\section{Introduction}
\section{Definition of Terms}
Radio frequency interference, hereafter refered to as RFI\cite{albert11a}. Epoch of reionization, hereafter refered to as EoR.

\section{body}
The foundations of the rigorous study of \emph{analysis}
were laid in the nineteenth century, notably by the
mathematicians Cauchy and Weierstrass. Central to the
study of this subject are the formal definitions of
\emph{limits} and \emph{continuity}.

Let $D$ be a subset of $\bf R$ and let
$f \colon D \to \mathbf{R}$ be a real-valued function on
$D$. The function $f$ is said to be \emph{continuous} on
$D$ if, for all $\epsilon > 0$ and for all $x \in D$,
there exists some $\delta > 0$ (which may depend on $x$)
such that if $y \in D$ satisfies
\[ |y - x| < \delta \]
then
\[ |f(y) - f(x)| < \epsilon. \]

One may readily verify that if $f$ and $g$ are continuous
functions on $D$ then the functions $f+g$, $f-g$ and
$f.g$ are continuous. If in addition $g$ is everywhere
non-zero then $f/g$ is continuous.
